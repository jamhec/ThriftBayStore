# ThriftBayStore
Project 1

My first app project with Android Studio. It is a super slimmed down, mock up of a online thrift store. 
It uses Retrofit and the Picasso library to render the images for the buy portion. 
On the seller's side of the store, user uploaded items are saved in a room database as a list.

Includes: MVVM pattern, RoomDb, and CRUD operations
